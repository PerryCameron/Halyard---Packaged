when removing a fee, it removes it from the database and the table, but when you click on a different fee and come back you
see it again.  If you reboot the fee tab it is gone.

If you click on a history tuple, open a field to edit but make no changes, it will give you a dialogue error

In Dialogue_DepositPDF, if deposit is empty it will throw an exception - low priority
